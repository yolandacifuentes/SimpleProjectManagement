# Simple Project Management

This is a sample project to demonstrate some of my software development skills for potential clients on Upwork. As the name implies, this is a simple project management system. It will keep track of tasks, group members, assignments, due dates, completion, priorities, among other details.

Due to NDAs, I’m unable to share the actual projects I’ve worked on in the past, but this repository highlights my experience across various technologies and architectural patterns.

The project is divided into **4 sub-projects**, each targeting a different layer of a modern software system.

## Sub-Projects
- [Desktop App](./DesktopApp/README.md) 
- [Mobile App](./MobileApp/README.md) 
- [Web App](./WebApp/README.md)  
- [Web Service](./WebService/README.md)  

Each project will include implementations in individual programming languages. The final product should mix and match implementations. You can run the rust webservice with the c# desktop app or node,js web app. There is a fifth folder shared code called [Shared](./Shared/README.md) which contains libraries, code and resources shared across multiple languages
